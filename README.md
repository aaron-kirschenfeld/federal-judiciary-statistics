# Federal Judiciary Statistics

The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts produces, among other things, reports on federal court caseloads. While working on another project, I noticed that these reports (specifically the satistical tables) were only available as PDF files. See [Federal Judicial Caseload Statistics 2015](http://www.uscourts.gov/statistics-reports/federal-judicial-caseload-statistics-2015-tables).

Here are two of these data tables which I created from the PDFs. For my purposes, only tables C and D were interesting since they provide broad overviews of District Court civil (Table C) and criminal (Table D) caseloads.
